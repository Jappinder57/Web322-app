            <p>
              Hi there, I'm Jappinderdeep Singh with Seneca ID 166128215 and I
              am an international student who came here overseas just to get to
              know the difference in the education system of my country, which
              is considered as a developing country, compared to this developed
              country. I wanted to learn things in a new way. I'm pursuing
              Computer Programming at Seneca College because it is one of the
              best colleges Canada has right now, and I wanted to learn about
              coding from a long time. I love to play soccer and volleyball, and
              I used to be a professional dancer too. I love to go out with my
              friends and have as much fun as I can.
            </p>
            <p>New things I wanna learn this year can be:</p>
            <li>
              <ol>
                Musical instrument like the guitar, piano or drums is always a
                great way of challenging yourself.
              </ol>
              <ol>
                Exploring music theory, getting to grips with sheet music and
                exploring different genres can all lead to an enhanced
                understanding of the varying degrees of musical expression.
              </ol>
              <ol>
                Photography provides opportunities to engage creativity for
                those wishing beautiful aesthetically pleasing outcomes all
                depending on honing skills such as composition and lighting
                techniques while experimenting with post-processing methods that
                enhance photos.
              </ol>
              <ol>
                Similarly, cooking and baking are fun-filled hobbies that allow
                people to experiment with ingredients and cultural heritage
                leading towards diverse cuisines from around the world by
                experimenting different recipes or cooking techniques.
              </ol>

                . It's an excellent hobby for anyone who has an eye for creative
                storytelling!
              </ol>
